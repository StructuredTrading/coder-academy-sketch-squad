                    <h3>Our Journey</h3>
                    <p>We, the Sketch Squad, entered the hackathon with enthusiasm to create a product that was both entertaining and practical. Although we initially aimed to develop a game, constraints and challenges redirected our efforts toward creating Sketch Offâ€”a sketchpad app. This pivot not only enriched our learning experience but also opened up possibilities for future enhancements.</p>
