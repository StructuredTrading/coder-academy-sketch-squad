                    <p>Sketch Off was developed as part of a hackathon project at Coder Academy. Initially envisioned as a game, it has evolved into a versatile sketchpad app. This project showcases not only our technical skills but also our capacity to innovate and adapt under pressure.</p>

                    <h3>Our Journey</h3>
                    <p>We, the Sketch Squad, entered the hackathon with enthusiasm to create a product that was both entertaining and practical. Although we initially aimed to develop a game, constraints and challenges redirected our efforts toward creating Sketch Offâ€”a sketchpad app. This pivot not only enriched our learning experience but also opened up possibilities for future enhancements.</p>
